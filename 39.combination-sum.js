 *
 * 
 * Given a set of candidate numbers (C) (without duplicates) and a target
 * number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers
 * sums to T. 
 * 
 * 
 * The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
 * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, 
 * A solution set is: 
 * 
 * [
 * ⁠ [7],
 * ⁠ [2, 2, 3]
 * ]
